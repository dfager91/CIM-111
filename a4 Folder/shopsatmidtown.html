A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At BÃ¼ro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week. <br>
